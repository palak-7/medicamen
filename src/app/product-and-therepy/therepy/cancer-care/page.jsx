            Cancer is the disease which is characterized by uncontrolled cell
            growth and in some cases it may metastasize (spread to the body).
            Cancer is the deadliest disease and this requires immediate
            attention of doctor. Despite of availability of number of anticancer
            drugs (oncology drugs) available for cancer cure, still much more is
            needed to be discovered. <br />

              Haematology is the science or study of blood, blood-forming organs
              and blood diseases. In the medical field, haematology includes the
              treatment of blood disorders and malignancies, including types of
              haemophilia, leukaemia, lymphoma and sickle-cell anaemia.
              Haematology is a branch of internal medicine that deals with the
              physiology, pathology, etiology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis
              and prevention of blood-related disorders.

              A tumor is an abnormal clump of cells. When your child has a solid
              tumor, that means the tumor doesn't contain any liquid or cysts.
              Solid tumors can develop in the muscles, bone, and organs of the
              body. Examples include mesothelioma, sarcomas, lymphomas, sarcomas
              as well as cancers of the breast, prostate, kidney, ovaries,
              pancreas, thyroid, and colon. Not all tumors are cancer. A tumor
              that does not have any cancer cells is called benign. A tumor with
              cancer cells is called malignant.

        <h3 className="font-semibold text-xl">Blood Cancer</h3>
        <h4 className="font-semibold mt-5">
          Blood cancer is an umbrella term for cancers that affect the blood,
          bone marrow and lymphatic system. There are three main types of blood
          cancer:
        </h4>
        <ul className=" list-disc text-left mx-20 mt-5 leading-loose">
          <li>
            <strong>Leukaemia:</strong>
            Leukaemia, a type of cancer found in your blood and bone marrow, is
            caused by the rapid production of abnormal white blood cells. The
            high number of abnormal white blood cells are not able to fight
            infection, and they impair the ability of the bone marrow to produce
            red blood cells and platelets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lymphoma:</strong>
            Lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that affects the lymphatic
            system, which removes excess fluids from your body and produces
            immune cells. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that fight
            infection. Abnormal lymphocytes become lymphoma cells, which
            multiply and collect in your lymph nodes and other tissues. Over
            time, these cancerous cells impair your immune system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Myeloma:</strong>
            Myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cells. Plasma cells are white
            blood cells that produce disease- and infection-fighting antibodies
            in your body. Myeloma cells prevent the normal production of
            antibodies, leaving your body's immune system weakened and
            susceptible to infection.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div className="text-center mt-10">
        <h1 className="font-bold text-3xl">SOLID TUMOR</h1>
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-xl">Major types of solid tumors</h3>
        <h4 className="font-semibold mt-5">
          Two major types of solid tumors are sarcomas and carcinomas. Many
          types of solid tumors, whether a sarcoma or a carcinoma, are often
          treated with surgery.
        </h4>
        <ul className=" list-disc text-left mx-20 mt-5 leading-loose">
          <li>
            <strong>Sarcomas :</strong>
            Sarcomas are tumors in a blood vessel, bone, fat tissue, ligament,
            lymph vessel, muscle or tendon.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Carcinomas :</strong>
            Carcinomas are tumors that form in epithelial cells. Epithelial
            cells are found in the skin, glands and the linings of organs. Those
            organs includes the bladder, ureters and part of the kidneys.
